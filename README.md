# LLM_transfer_training

The work is a Python function designed to fine-tune a pre-trained language model using a given dataset. 

This training model accepts the following parameters:

model: A pre-trained language model that you want to fine-tune.
text_dataset: A DatasetDict containing 'train' and 'test' datasets, each consisting of text data in the form of prompts and completions.
learning_rate: The learning rate for the optimizer (default is 0.001).
num_epochs: The number of epochs to train the model (default is 3).
batch_size: The number of samples per batch during training (default is 1).
pre_trained_tokenizer: The tokenizer associated with the pre-trained model used for encoding the text data.


The Main Function Body

Set the Model to Training Mode:
model.train()
This ensures the model is in training mode, enabling gradient calculation and other training-specific behaviors.

Prepare the Optimizer:
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
The AdamW optimizer is created to update the model parameters based on the gradients calculated during training.

Create Data Loaders:
train_loader = DataLoader(text_dataset['train'], batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(text_dataset['test'], batch_size=batch_size)
Data loaders are created for both training and validation datasets. The training data loader is shuffled to ensure the model doesn't memorize the sequence of the data.

Training Loop:
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    total_loss = 0
    model.train()
The function iterates over the number of epochs. For each epoch:
The model is set to training mode again.
The total loss for the epoch is initialized.

Batch Processing:
for batch in train_loader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
For each batch:

Gradients are zeroed out to prevent accumulation from previous batches.
Tokenization:
inputs = pre_trained_tokenizer(batch['prompt'], return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=1024)
labels = pre_trained_tokenizer(batch['completion'], return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=1024).input_ids
The prompt and completion texts in the batch are tokenized to convert them into tensors that the model can process.

Length Adjustment:
min_len = min(inputs['input_ids'].shape[1], labels.shape[1])
input_ids = inputs['input_ids'][:, :min_len]
labels = labels[:, :min_len]
To ensure consistency, both input_ids and labels are truncated to the same length.

Label Adjustment:
labels[labels == pre_trained_tokenizer.pad_token_id] = -100
Padding tokens in the labels are set to -100 so that they are ignored in the loss calculation.

Forward Pass:
outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=inputs['attention_mask'][:, :min_len], labels=labels)
loss = outputs.loss
The model performs a forward pass, generating outputs and calculating the loss.

Backward Pass and Optimization:
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
The gradients are calculated and the optimizer updates the model parameters.

Loss Accumulation:
total_loss += loss.item()
The loss for the batch is accumulated to calculate the average loss for the epoch.

Validation:
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    for batch in val_loader:
After each epoch, the model is evaluated on the validation dataset. During evaluation, the model is set to evaluation mode, and gradient calculations are disabled for efficiency.

Validation Tokenization: Similar to training, the validation data is tokenized and truncated.

Validation Accuracy Calculation:
accuracy = correct_predictions / total_predictions if total_predictions > 0 else 0
The function calculates how many of the model's predictions match the actual completions in the validation data, computing the accuracy for that epoch.

Completion Message:
print("Training completed.")
Finally, a message is printed to indicate that the training process is complete.
